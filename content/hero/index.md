I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Engineering Data Science from the [University of Houston](https://uh.edu/)(December'24) , specializing in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor of Technology from IIT (BHU) Varanasi, where I built a strong foundation in computer science and software engineering.

I have worked as a AI/ML Engineer at [Xebia IT Architects](https://xebia.com/).

I'm actively seeking a full-time role where I can contribute my skills in coding and finding efficient solutions.

Together, we can teach machines to imagine!
